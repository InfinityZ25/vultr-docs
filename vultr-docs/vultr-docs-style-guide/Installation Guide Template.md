## Introduction

A short introduction to orient the reader is usually appropriate. This section is rarely more than one paragraph. Briefly describe what the reader will learn and what to expect from the documentation.

Notice that the first section starts with Heading 2. The title field on the submission form is Heading 1.

## Prerequisites

Briefly describe the prerequisite environment or knowledge needed to perform the steps in this document. Bullet points are often suitable for this information. For example, you may include:

* The server OS required
* The amount of memory or disk space required
* Required pre-install software packages
* Reader skill level

## 1. The First Step

Break your documentation into logical sections. Use heading 2 for major section headers. Preface steps with step numbers. Use numerals, not words. Use Title Case.

Code blocks are prefaced by four spaces. Command lines should be prefaced by a prompt. If a linux root user, use a hash prompt. If a standard user, use a dollar sign. If PowerShell or Windows cmd.exe use the appropriate prompt to preface your commands.

Linux root user performing `ls`:

    # ls

Linux standard user performing `ls`:

    $ ls

PowerShell user performing `ls`:

    PS C:\> ls

Windows cmd.exe user performing `dir`. Note that cmd doesn't leave a space between the prompt and the command by default, but it's recommended to do so for clarity in documentation.

    C:\> dir

## 2. The Next Step

A typical document may have as few as two, and rarely more than ten major sections.

Inline code should be wrapped by backticks. For example, you could instruct the user to perform `ls` in your narrative. This can be convenient, but code blocks are preferred. Reserve backticks for actual commands. Do not use backticks are a replacement for bold or italics. Use bold for the names of GUI objects, such as buttons, icons, or input fields. Use italics for the information to be typed. For example, this would be correct:

* Click the **Done** button, then type :key_win:+:key_r:.
* Type _cmd.exe_ in the **Open** field, then click **OK**.
* When the command window opens, type `dir` at the prompt.

### Subsections for minor sub-steps

Each major Heading 2 section may also contain multiple subsections. Use Heading 3 for subsections. Use sentence case for subsections.

### Another subsection

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Morbi sit amet blandit arcu. Phasellus ac massa vel nisi sodales pretium id non nibh. Proin et quam mattis, dapibus turpis nec, vestibulum justo. Morbi vitae viverra metus. Integer blandit accumsan ipsum, vitae tincidunt sem lobortis ac. Sed dictum in elit vel cursus. Nunc commodo massa mi, vel imperdiet nunc volutpat vestibulum. Morbi rhoncus magna non aliquet faucibus. Curabitur ac vulputate urna, quis condimentum velit. Vivamus fringilla porttitor pretium. Mauris convallis turpis nisi, eget pharetra est lacinia at. Maecenas sed pharetra sapien. Praesent et eros pharetra ipsum iaculis aliquam.

## 3. The Last Step

This is the last major section of this template. Your document may have more sections.

## Conclusion

Refresh the reader on what they have accomplished and what capabilities they have enabled. If appropriate, you may consider some of the following subsections.

### Further steps

This is a good place to link additional tutorials or recommend some standard settings.

### References

Consider including a few bullet points with links more documentation or comprehensive references. For example:

* Links to GitHub projects
* Links to Linux distribution documentation
* Links to the application documentation
